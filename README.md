This repository contains my notes made in in Jupyter Notebooks from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate courses:
- Python for Data Science and AI
- Data Analysis with Python

For the first four courses: What is Data Science?, Open Sorce tools for Data Science, Data Science Methodology, and Databases and SQL for Data Science the notes was taken in WORD (now a PDF).
